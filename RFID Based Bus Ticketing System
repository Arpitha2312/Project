RFID
1.Each passenger is provided with an RFID tag that stores their personal information, such as name and contact number.
2.The RFID tag is linked to a passenger's account or wallet, so the fare is automatically deducted when they board the transport system.
RFID Reader:

Installed at entry/exit points of the transport system, the RFID reader scans the tag when a passenger boards or alights.
The RFID reader communicates with the microcontroller to process the information and compute the distance traveled.
Microcontroller:

This is the heart of the system, managing data between the RFID reader, the passenger's RFID tag, and the fare system.
The microcontroller ensures that the fare is calculated correctly based on the distance traveled and stores transaction information securely.
Fare Calculation:

Based on the information received from the RFID reader, the system computes the fare automatically based on the passenger's destination.
It deducts the fare from the passenger's account or linked digital wallet.
Ticketing:

Once the fare is deducted, a ticket is issued, containing details like the source, destination, and fare. This ticket can be displayed on the passenger's mobile phone.
The GSM modem is used to send the ticket details to the passenger's mobile phone via SMS or app notification.
GSM Modem:

The GSM modem communicates with the passengerâ€™s mobile phone, sending the ticket or fare receipt to them in real-time.
It can also send alerts about balance, upcoming stops, or other important notifications.


Benefits of the System:
1).Automated Fare Collection: The system automates fare deduction based on distance, eliminating the need for manual ticketing and reducing human error.
2).Efficiency: It improves the efficiency of the transportation system by speeding up boarding times and reducing queues at ticket counters.
3).Passenger Convenience: Passengers no longer need to carry physical tickets. Instead, their tickets are automatically generated and sent to their mobile devices.
4).Improved Revenue Management: Governments or transport operators can ensure that the correct fare is collected, reducing the chances of fraud and fare evasion.
5).Real-time Tracking: With RFID and GSM, the system can track passengers and vehicles in real-time, providing data for operational optimization.
6).Security: The system can be programmed to ensure the data is secure and only authorized passengers are allowed to travel.
